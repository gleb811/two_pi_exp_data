E_beam = 2.445 GeV for Q^2 = 0.65 GeV^2 and Q^2 = 0.95 GeV^2
E_beam = 4.0 GeV for Q^2 = 1.3 GeV^2
0.5 < Q2 < 1.5 GeV^2
1.4 < W < 1.9 GeV for Q^2 = 0.65 GeV^2 and Q^2 = 0.95 GeV^2
1.4 < W < 2.1 GeV for Q^2 = 1.3 GeV^2

Notations "_v1", "_v2", and "_v3" at the end of the file names correspond to the integration over different sets of kinematical variables.

Files "xsec_mdiff.dat" contain five-differential cross sections. They exist only for Q^2 = 0.65 GeV^2 and Q^2 = 1.3 GeV^2. Note: due to the limited statistics/run duration there are many kinematical cells with zero cross section.
